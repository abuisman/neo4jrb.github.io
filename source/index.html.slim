            Neo4j.rb (the [neo4j](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j) and [neo4j-core](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-core) gems) is a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) Object-Graph-Mapper (OGM) for the [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com) graph database. It tries to follow API conventions established by [ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) and familiar to most Ruby developers but with a Neo4j flavor.

          | If you're already familiar with ActiveRecord, DataMapper, or Mongoid, you'll find the Object Model features you've come to expect from an O*M:
          ul
            li Properties
            li Indexes / Constraints
            li Callbacks
            li Validation
            li Assocations
          | Because relationships are first-class citizens in Neo4j, models can be created for both nodes and relationships.

            In your `Gemfile`

            ```ruby
              gem 'neo4j'
            ```

            A sample ActiveNode model

            ```ruby
             class User
                include Neo4j::ActiveNode

                property :name
                property :age, type: Integer

                has_many :out, :friends, type: :friends_with, class_name: 'User'
                has_one :in,   :github_profile, type: :linked_to  # class_name: 'GithubProfile' assumed
              end
            ```

            Using query chaining to get the github profiles for a user's friends

            ```ruby
              user.friends.github_profile
            ```

        h4 Simple queries
        p
          markdown:
            If you just want to execute some raw cypher queries you only need the `neo4j-core` gem.

            ```ruby
              neo4j_session = Neo4j::Session.open(:server_db, ENV['NEO4J_DB_URL'])

              me = neo4j_session.query('MATCH (found:User) WHERE found.name = {aName} RETURN found',
                                       aName: 'Andreas').first.found
            ```

            There is also a query-building API which allows you to build cypher queries with method chaining:

            ```ruby
              user = neo4j_session.query.match(found: :User).
                                          where(found: {name: 'Andreas'}).
                                          return(:user).
                                          first.found
            ```

            At each step in the chain a query object is returned which is also `Enumerable`.  See the [documentation](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-core/wiki/Queries) for more info.

            Also note that with the query chaining there is no need to use params (which are important for efficient neo4j queries).  They will be used in the background in this case.
