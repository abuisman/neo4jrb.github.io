        With the release of the Neo4j.rb v4 right around the corner, it seemed like a good time to finally put together a proper site for the gem and the Neo4jrb project as a whole. We hope to use this space as a resource for news updates, documentation, and general tips related to the Neo4j Ruby community.

        Since we're a little light on content, what should you look at in the meantime? Well, you could try...

        * [The gem changelog](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/blob/master/CHANGELOG)
        * [The detailed Neo4j gem v4 notes](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/wiki/Neo4j.rb-v4-Introduction)
        * [The Twitter Analytics project](https://github.com/neo4jrb/twitter_analytics)
