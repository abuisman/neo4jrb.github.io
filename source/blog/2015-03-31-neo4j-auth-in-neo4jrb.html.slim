        Neo4j 2.2.0 [came out recently](http://neo4j.com/whats-new-in-neo4j-2-2/) and, of course, we've very excited!  One of the biggest changes you should know about if you're trying to use Neo4j.rb with Neo4j 2.2.0 is that authentication is required by default.  It's implemented using HTTP Basic Auth and we've updated the latest version of the `neo4j-core` gem (which the `neo4j` gem depends on) to support it.

        ## Using sessions

        If you're creating `Session` objects directly from the `neo4j-core` gem, you just need to add some configuration options:

        ```
          session = Neo4j::Session.open(:server_db,
                                        'http://localhost:7474',
                                        basic_auth: {username: 'neo4j', password: 'reel_secure'})
        ```

        ## In Rails

        If you're using Rails it's just as easy.  You only need to configure it in one of your environment files (such as `config/development.rb` or `config/production.rb`) or the `config/application.rb` file:

        ```
          config.neo4j.session_type = :server_db 
          config.neo4j.session_path = 'http://localhost:7474'
          config.neo4j.session_options = { basic_auth: { username: 'foo', password: 'bar'} } 
        ```

        ## Disabling authentication

        If you're in a hurry or just don't want to bother with authentication in your development or test environments, you can disable configure the `dbms.security.auth_enabled` variable in `conf/neo4j-server.properties`:

        ```
          dbms.security.auth_enabled=false
        ```

        If you've installed your Neo4j database via the Neo4j.rb rake tasks, this is located in `db/neo4j/development/conf/neo4j-server.properties`


        Happy Graphing!
