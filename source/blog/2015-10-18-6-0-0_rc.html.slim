      markdown:
        We've released the 6.0.0.alpha.x series.  Please change your `Gemfiles` to give it a try!

        There are a lot of cover changes, but we had some items which weren't backwards compatible, hence the new major version.  To see the recent changes check out the CHANGELOGs for [neo4j](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and [neo4j-core](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j-core/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

        Don't be fooled by the `alpha` designation, we aim for stable releases and have a large test suite for the gems!

        As always: see our [README](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j/) for the best ways to get help!
